# PY485 Final Project â€“ Muon ROOT Analysis

This repository contains my final project for PY485E: Computational Physics at CERN, Spring 2025.

The assignment involved analyzing muon detector data stored in ROOT format using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. I used the `uproot` and `numpy` libraries to explore event structures, perform selections, and visualize physical quantities.

### Contents

- `Problem 1.ipynb` through `Problem 5.ipynb`: Sequential notebooks solving five structured problems involving muon event data
- `MuRun2010B_withoutM.csv`: Supporting event data file
- `muons_v2.root`: Original detector output in ROOT format

### Key Concepts

- Event selection and filtering from `.root` files
- Histogramming and distribution fitting
- Momentum and energy reconstruction from particle data
- Data processing using `uproot`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`

### Tools Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `uproot` (for ROOT file parsing)
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`

This project was completed as part of my undergraduate research and coursework during my semester at CERN, under the supervision of the EP-CMO group.
